# About

I create this with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and [`svelte-add`](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add).
Features:
- typescript
- playwright
- eslint & prettier
- vitest

I additionally added:
1. Some basic tailwinds usage and theming with typography
2. .js instead of .cjs tailwind config
3. postcss-nesting (and it's configuration with tailwindcss/nesting which is kind of annoying)
4. cssnano
5. pnpm (although you can get this with create-svelte also)
6. renamed app.postcss to app.css
