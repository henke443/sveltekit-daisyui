# About

I create this with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte) and [`svelte-add`](https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add). Then I did some manual changes.

### Commands:
- `pnpm start:node` to build and run the production node server (SSR)
- `pnpm start:static` to build the static site and open the index.html in your browser
- `pnpm dev` to run dev server
- `pnpm test` to do unit and integrationt ests
- Check package.json for more commands

### Features:
- typescript
- playwright
- eslint & prettier
- vitest
- vscode settings & extension recommendations
- postcss with tailwindcss, cssnano, import & nesting plugins
- @sveltejs/adapter-node & @sveltejs/adapter-static and a easy way to switch between them
- pnpm lockfile
