# About

I create this with [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).
(with typescript, and playwright, eslint, prettier, and all other features you can get from create-svelte)
I additionally added:
1. Some basic tailwinds usage and theming with typography
2. .js instead of .cjs tailwind config
3. postcss-nesting (and it's configuration with tailwindcss/nesting which is kind of annoying)
4. cssnano
5. pnpm (although you can get this with create-svelte also)
6. renamed app.postcss to app.css
